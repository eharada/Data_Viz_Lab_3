The following charts support the claim that the financial markets do not punish security breaches. The first two iterations focused on the healthcare industry. However the final data visualization looks at all industries.

## 1st Iteration: 
Display the years that the data breaches happened and also display the stock prices around those years to see if there were steady movements or severe peaks during those times.

The disadvantage with the above graph is that it is a little confusing to see 4 different charts. The reader might have trouble following the data visualizations. The next iteration should try to combine all the graphs together.

<br/><br/>

## 2nd Iteration: 
The charts show a comparison of data breaches and stock prices per year. It is shown that there is a general increase in the closing prices over the years in healthcare. This chart shows a trend over time, however it would be nice to see more granular details of closing prices per month or quarter.

## Final Iteration: 
The top chart shows the stock price increase per year while the bottom chart shows the magnitude of each data breach in 2014 and 2016. The stock price chart takes the difference between the highest and lowest closing prices per year.

<br/>
The data visualizations show that security breaches do not affect the financial market in the United States. This is in line with the study as it shows how the United States takes vast measures after security breaches. The cost for recovery for the United States is, on average, much higher than the average for all countries. This shows that the United States has the resources to bounce back after each breach, which lead to higher confidence in the financial market. With higher confidence, you are less likely to see a sudden increase or decrease in stock prices.

<br/><br/>
Advantage: This stock price chart shows the years the data breaches occurred. This is helpful in seeing the difference between the highest and lowest closing dates around that time to see if there was a vast increase, decrease, or if it remained relatively steady.
<br/>
Disadvantage: This shows an overview per year of stock prices changes. However, it doesn't show the daily or weekly changes in stock prices. It would be beneficial to see the exact date of the data breaches and then compare the stock prices around that date.

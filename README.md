The following charts support the claim that the financial markets do not punish security breaches.

Focusing in healthcare

## 1st Iteration: Display when the data breaches happened and then show the stock prices around those years to see if there was steady movement or severe peaks during those times.

The above graph is a little confusing to see 4 different charts. The next iteration should try to combine all the graphs together.

## 2nd Iteration: The charts show a comparison with the years lined up. It is shown that there is a general increase in the closing prices over the years in healthcare. However it would be nice to see more granular details of closing prices per week.

The above graphs depict a general increase in healthcare stock prices regardless of the data breaches. This is in line with the study as the healthcare industry on average has a much higher per capita cost for security breaches than any other sector. The higher costs are attributed to heavy regulations. Because of the heavy regulations, the stock market doesn't lose confidence in this industry. The stock market can see that healthcare puts more resources into data breaches and are able to bounce back, which show as their costs are twice the amount of the average cost. They know that healtcare is able to bounce back after these data breaches. With higher confidence, you are less likely to see a sudden decrease in stock prices.

<br/></br>
Advantage: This stock price chart shows the greyed out area of which year the data breaches occurred. This is helpful in seeing the closing dates around that time to see if there was a vast increase, decrease, or if it remained relatively steady.
</br>
Disadvantage: This shows an overview per month and year of stock prices changes. It doesn't show the daily or weekly changes in stock prices. This would be beneficial to have more accurate data of when the data breach occurred and compare the stock prices surrounding those weeks.

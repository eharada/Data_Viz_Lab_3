The following charts support the claim that the financial markets do not punish security breaches. This data visualization focuses in healthcare.

## 1st Iteration: 
Display the years that the data breaches happened and also display the stock prices around those years to see if there were steady movements or severe peaks during those times.

The disadvantage with the above graph is that it is a little confusing to see 4 different charts. The reader might have trouble following the data visualizations. The next iteration should try to combine all the graphs together.

## 2nd Iteration: 
The charts show a comparison of data breaches and stock prices per year. It is shown that there is a general increase in the closing prices over the years in healthcare. This chart shows a trend over time, however it would be nice to see more granular details of closing prices per month or quarter.

## (Final) Iteration: The top chart shows the stock price increase per quarter. The grey boxes show the years with data breaches in the healthcare industry. The bottom chart shows the magnitude of each data breach in 2014 and 2016.

<br/>
The above graphs depict a general increase in healthcare stock prices regardless of the data breaches. This is in line with the study as the healthcare industry, on average, has a much higher per capita cost for security breaches than any other sector. The stock market is confident that healthcare is able to put more resources into data breaches and are able to bounce back to meet heavy regulations. With higher confidence, you are less likely to see a sudden increase or decrease in stock prices.

<br/>
Advantage: This stock price chart shows the years the data breaches occurred. This is helpful in seeing the closing dates around that time to see if there was a vast increase, decrease, or if it remained relatively steady.
</br>
Disadvantage: This shows an overview per month and year of stock prices changes. It doesn't show the daily or weekly changes in stock prices. It would be beneficial to see the exact date of the data breaches and then compare the stock prices around that date.
